# Obscura 🔒

Obscura is a secure and efficient system for storing credentials in microservices-based architectures. Built with **Rust**, **fjall** and **Actix**, it ensures that keys, tokens, and secrets are managed reliably and accessible only to authorized services.

## 📖 Origin of the Name

The name **Obscura** was inspired by the expression **"Camera Obscura"**, an optical device used to project images protected from external light. Just as the camera obscura keeps images hidden until they are revealed, **Obscura** protects credentials and secrets until they are accessed by authorized systems.

In addition, "Obscura" refers to the concept of something safe, secure, and inaccessible to those without permission.

## 🔊 Pronunciation

The correct pronunciation of **Obscura** is:

📢 **/ob·sku·ra/** (*ob-scu-ra*)

## 🚀 Features

- 🔐 **Secure storage** of credentials, API keys, and secrets.

- ⚡ **High performance** with **Rust**, **fjall** and **Actix**.

- 🔄 **Automatic rotation** of keys and tokens (optional).

- 📜 **Logs and auditing** for access tracking.
